# Malware-GAN-attack
We implement MalGAN to attack several robust models and evaluate the performance of those robust models.

## Introduction
The GAN attacker has a generator and a substitute detector(discriminator). The generator takes a malware feature vector m, and a noise vector z (append at the end) as input and generates an adversarial example based on that malware sample. The substitute detector is used to fit the behavior of the blackbox classifier and feed the gradient information back to the generator. The idea is based on [Generating Adversarial Malware Examples for Black-Box Attacks Based on GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05983.pdf) by Weiwei Hu and Ying Tan.

## Data

**Train Data:** 13190 samples, each with 3514 API features. The first 6896 are malware example; the last 6294 are benign examples.

**Test Data:** 3435 malware samples, each with 3514 API features.
